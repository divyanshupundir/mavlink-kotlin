# api
![badge][badge-android]

## Overview

Interfaces, annotations and wrapper/helper classes for the MAVLink protocol. These are used by the `generator` module
for creating the enums, messages and dialects. MAVLink classes generated by any other generator would still work with
the other modules given that `api` is implemented correctly.

## Usage

```kotlin
implementation("com.divpundir.mavlink:api:$version")
```
